            Sometimes Danish is taught in a more complicated way than it needs
            to be. This website is an attempt to simplify the learning process
            by breaking down the language into its most basic components and to
            clarify the most confusing parts.

            Lots of the examples are taken directly from the book "DANSK
            MINIGRAMMATIK" by Mette Hansen, Henriette Kaspersen
