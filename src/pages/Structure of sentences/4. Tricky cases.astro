      Så can mean many things in danish, and it means the following things
      related to connecting sentences:
    </p>
    <ul class="max-w-2xl mx-auto text-justify">
      <li>Then - Så gik jeg til skole.</li>
      <li>So - Jeg vidste ikke, så jeg slog det op i ordbogen.</li>
      <li>
        So that - Jeg brændte mit hus af, så jeg nemt kunne få forsikringspenge.

  <Section title="When it means: THEN (series of events)">
    <p class="max-w-2xl mx-auto text-justify hyphens-auto">
      It starts a <span class={COLORS.MainClause.class}>Main Clause</span>, so
      because "så" is not a subject, it follows <span class="font-bold"
        >inversion</span
      >.
    </p>

    <p class="max-w-2xl mx-auto text-justify hyphens-auto">
      Tricky because you need more context to understand the sentence, so it
      can't technically "stand alone" and be a main clause, yet it is.

      It connects <span class={COLORS.MainClause.class}>Main Clauses</span> without
      even inversion, like "og" (and) and "eller" (or).

      Tricky because you need more context to understand the sentence, so it
      can't technically "stand alone" and be a main clause, yet it is. At the
      same time, it doesn't even apply inversion.
